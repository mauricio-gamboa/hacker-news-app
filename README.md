# Hacker News App! (Optimized for mobile)

Thank you for taking your time and agreeing to take this challenge as part of our recruitment process. We understand that sometimes it can be hard to find enough time to dedicate yourself properly to this type of activity, so if for any reason you have problems related to it let us know and communicate properly what you've done and what you were still planning to do if you had more time. 

The challenge is to build _YOUR OWN IMPLEMENTATION_ of the [Hacker News website](https://news.ycombinator.com/). For doing so, you are encouraged to consume data from the open HN api - https://github.com/HackerNews/API, but this is not a requirement. This compressed folder has a git repository initialized. You are supposed to version your files and describe your changes using git, so there should be a `.git` folder accompanying your solution. 

The objective of this challenge is to assess your ability with React, so we expect you to use React to build the solution. You are free to use any tools you want to create tests for your application, if you feel like doing it.

The application code will be reviewed and the application itself will be tested on a high-end mobile device.

You don't have to worry with the back-end implementation. When testing we'll make sure we serve the files on this repository properly.

Imagine that you are already working at Werkspot, we want to build an improved version of HN and you were assigned the task to start it's front-end implementation.

From the moment we send you this repository, you have 48 hours to work on it.

Feel free to ask us any questions and have fun!

## Available Scripts

Important! Please install the node modules with `npm start` before running the scripts.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

If you want to run the production build locally, navigate to the build folder in the terminal and start a local server.
